<p>Infosys Labstorm is the Infosys Showcase and Co-creation, Collaboration platform with a
Social Networking essence to it.</p>
<p>    
It is a joint offering by the Product R&amp;D Group and Infosys Labs, the latter being the
higher and more research-focused group in Infosys. It is presently available for use on the
Infosys intranet and on the internet at <a href="http://www.InfosysLabstorm.com" target="_blank">www.InfosysLabstorm.com</a>. The platform was
being developed by a team of 6-8 people.
</p>
<p>
My work and responsibilities in this project were to be involved with every aspect of the
project ranging from brain-storming the requirements, to planning the user-experience
with the designer, to coding on the front-end and back-end.
The project uses the latest web-technologies including HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Responsive
web design, JSON, AJAX, Database technologies including MS-SQL and MongoDB along
with .NET MVC architecture.
</p>
<p>
I handled some of the core functionalities of the project with focus on the Website Design,
User Experience, Responsiveness for iPad, Tablets and desktops, cross-browser issues. I
proactively suggested the use of NoSQL databases (as I had previous experience due to
my final year college project) as part of some new functionalities we were developing. I
solely, researched in the areas of integrating MongoDB with the existing platform and
developed functionalities that were later used by the entire team for their work. I made
major contributions to the Front-end interface of the platform by developing the basic
structure to make it responsive for tablets.
</p>
<p>
This platform is currently being used by over 1,50,000 Infosys employees over the intranet
and several clients of Infosys over the internet. Also, a modified version of the platform is
currently being used by the United Nations for their initiatives in India and by the Israeli
Export Institute.
