<p>Elgg is an open-source social networking engine that provides a robust framework on which to build all kinds of social environments, from a campus wide social network for a university, school or college to an internal collaborative platform for an organization. 
</p>
<p>
Elgg is currently structured to work with relational databases (MySQL). As part of our final year project, our aim was to demonstrate how Elgg could work with NoSQL databases (CouchDB), as a lot of data in case of Social Networking platforms is un-structured. Our main aim was to &quot;Rewrite how Elgg interacts with Relational Database and replacing it with a Non-relational Datastore and thus, providing it with the capability and efficiency to scale well for millions of simultaneous queries.&quot;
</p>
<p>
This was a team project comprising of four people and was an un-conventional final-year project.
