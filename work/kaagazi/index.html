<p> As a freelance developer, I helped one of my close friends, in finishing her ecommerce
website for selling Hand-made notebooks, currently put up at
<a href='http://www.Kaagazi.com' target="_blank">www.kaagazi.com</a></p>
<p>
My friend, Kavya Agrawal, is a trained graphic designer, from NID, Ahmedabad who
started this venture. I helped her develop the front-end of her store that uses the
Shopify platform. Apart from contributing to the interface development,I also
gave inputs to the visual design of the website.
</p>
<p>
Her strong background in Graphic Design and my background in web-development
and design interests helped us develop something, we both are really proud of. I
continue to help her with the website related issues and also in promoting her
business in Bangalore.
</p>
<p>
Her opinion about me shared on Facebook:
<p><span class='italics'>"A big shout out and thank you to my friend Mayank Khanna for all the help and support with Kaagazi- Handbound books. How gracefully he proves that you dont need a degree to be a designer and you dont need proximity to be a friend. Thanks a lot Mayank, your friendship is truly humbling."</span>
