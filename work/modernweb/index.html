<p>
As part of my interests in areas of web design and development, various HCI-related processes
and a background in responsive web development, I researched in areas of Modern Web
applications, the technologies available for ease of development and code maintainability. I
gathered my study in form of a presentation, currently being used to present to several
prospective clients across Infosys.

<p>    
Parts of the presentation also include my work in areas of responsive web development and
Hybrid applications, as mentioned earlier. The presentation served as a useful resource for
knowledge transfers and proved very fruitful in presenting the capabilities of Infosys in this area
to clients.
