<p>This was a short-term project wherein a client-oriented demo application was prepared for
iPad in a strict-deadline of one week.
</p>
<p>    
I was single-handedly involved in creation of the app wherein I worked on every aspect of
the application from Conceptualization to itâ€™s Design, User-Experience, Usability and
responsiveness in addition to coding it from scratch.
</p>
<p>
The main structure of the application was developed within a week and was continuously
refined with further capabilities by me while it was being presented to several authorities
at the client location.
</p>
<p>    
I migrated the existing application for the Microsoft Windows 8 platform as well, as it was
a new area being explored by the organization.
