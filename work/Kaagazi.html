        <h1>Building the Kaagazi partner stores experience</h1>
        <h2>Kaagazi - The Brand</h2>
            <p>Founded by my school friend and a trained graphic designer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavya-agrawal-38485850/" target="_blank">Kavya Agarwal↗︎</a>, Kaagazi is a direct to consumer lifestyle brand based out of India. The brand sells paper and leather goods through an online store at <a href="https://www.kaagazi.com" target="_blank">Kaagazi.com↗︎</a></p>
            <p>The early-stage brand has a humble presence on Facebook and Instagram which is growing quickly as we take efforts into promoting the brand in both, domestic and international markets. The online sales are handled through a shopify store and the sales are augmented through advertisements on Facebook and Instagram.

        <h2 class="left_1col">Role</h2>
        <p class="midContent right_3col">While my work with Kaagazi involves wearing multiple hats, I primarily focus on brand/business strategy along with taking care of the design and development work on the online store. My background in ux design and programming allows me to deliver a beautiful and smooth online shopping experience to our customers.</p>
        <p class="midContent right_3col">For this specific project, I got a high-level problem which was structured into detailed requirements. These requirements were then translated into concepts which were finally implemented in code. <span class="semibold">I led the project from concept to implementtation.</span></p>

           <h2>Framing the problem</h2> 
           <p>In early months of 2019, Kavya informed me that she was partnering with physical stores all across India. She wanted to showcase her products in boutique stores so that offline shoppers all across India could experience them, as e-commerce is still in it's early stages back in India. We wanted to inform our website visitors that our products were being sold offline as well.</p>
           <h3 class="left_1col">The goal</h3>
        <p class="midContent right_3col"><span class="semibold">Make Kaagazi's website visitors aware about our growing offline presence.</span></p>
           <h3>Identifying requirements</h3>
           <p>With the high-level goal in mind, I started identifying detailed requirements to achieve the goal. Questions like number of stores within a city and number of locations to represent were asked to account for scalability within the design. Further discussion was done to identify the store information that should be shown in order for it to be useful for our users.</p>
           <p><span class="semibold">Image of questions for requirements</span></p>

    <section class="content">
           <h2>Brainstorming possible solutions</h2> 
           <p>As we ironed out the requirements, I started brainstorming on the possible approaches we could take to showcase the stores on the website.</p>
           <p><span class="semibold">Possible options</span></p>
           <p>Based on the requirements and the way the experience would scale, we decided that the maps based approach might work for us. With that approach in mind, I dug deeper into design iterations for the aprticular approach.</p>
           <p><span class="semibold">Decision on options</span></p>
    </section>
    <section class="content">
           <h2>A quickly failed iteration</h2>
           <p>The option we decided to iterate on expected the user to click on a state on the map and based on the state that was clicked, the stores in that state would be shown across all the cities in that state.</p>
           <p>As I iterated on the concept, I identified a problem. The areas of Goa and New Delhi (neither identified as states or cities), were too small to serve as a click target for the user. Identified as large metropolitan areas within India, these areas were very likely to have the partner stores and hence, I decided to switch my approach...</p>
           <p><span class="semibold">Show state solution</span></p>
           <p>Instead of expecting the user to click on different states, I decided to represent the cities directly on the map. The user would be able to click on a particular city and see the stores that are present within that city.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Identifying development concerns</h2>
        <p>With the basic understanding of the design nailed down in concept, I decided to start looking at ways to implement the design. I looked at different map frameworks and decided to use <a href="http://mapbox.com" target="_blank">Mapbox↗︎</a> for the solution as it offereed the most number of possibilities to customize the map. Since, the shopify platform does not provide a data storing mechanism for external content, I decided to use <a href="http://airtable.com" target="_blank">Airtable↗︎</a> for storing the store and location data.</p>

        <h2>Back to design iterations...</h2>
        <p>Feeling confident with the development frameworks and the high-level design, I started iterating on how we could present the store information to the users.</p>
        <p>After some iteration and brainstorming, we decided to represent a store's phone number, their address and their hours of operation to make it convenient for our users. We also decided to include a direct link to the store on Google maps to make it even more convenient for our mobile users. </p>
        <p>In addition, we decided against including the store's website address as most of these stores do not have an online presence and if they do, it is not as polished as Kaagazi's own online presence.</p>

        <h2>Theming the map</h2>
        <p>Using the mapbox studio, I iterated on several visual themes that could blend well with Kaagazi's black and white brand aesthectic. This also gave us the opportunity to explore the different colors we could integrate with the brand as we aim to build a more colorful brand aesthetic in the near future.</p>

        <h2>Bringing it all together</h2>
        <p>On integrating the experience with the existing website, there were further visual improvements we made to ensure clarity and readability. Since the existing website uses different kind of transitions to keep the user engaged and excited, I explored different kind of transitions on scroll. The finalized transition was tweaked on timing, delay and moment of intiation to make the experience look cohesive.</p>

        <h2>Making it responsive</h2>
        <p>After integrating the experience, I looked at ways to scale the experience across multiple device sizes. Since, most of Kaagazi's online traffic is mobile-driven, the experience had to scale across different mobile form factors. By scaling down the map size, tweaking font size and repositioning of layout the experience was made responsive and works across different device types.</p>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>While the web will always be our primary sales channel, indicating our offline partner stores on the website helps us build a brand recognition outside the web.</p>
        <p>Since, rolling out the experience in March, we did notice increase in our offline sales. While all the offline sales cannot be attributed to the stores experience on the website, we did start noticing an interest in the partner stores by our customers.</p>
        <p><span class="semibold">Show sales chart</span></p>
        <p>We started hearing that our customers got a first-hand experience of the product at one of our partner stores before they made a purchase on the website. Considering the fact that e-commerce is still in it's nascent stages in India, the ability for us to get an online purchase through this combination of offline and online experience opens multiple possibilities as we try to scale our brand.</p>
