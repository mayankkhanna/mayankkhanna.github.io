        <h1>Reliving Digital Memories in the Snapchat Era</h1>
        <h2>Kodak Moments</h2>
            <p>Over the summer of 2015, I interned as an Interaction designer with Kodak Alaris and got the opportunity to work on the company's flagship mobile app, <a href="www.kodakmomemts.com">Kodak Moments</a>.</p>
            <p>I worked on the future iterations of the app to incorporate upcoming features and new functionalities. My project was focused towards understanding the problems faced by users in managing their photographic memories, increase the user engagement within the app and allow users to create photo products in an easier manner.</p>
            <p>Several concepts that were explored and prototyped as part of those user studies have now been incorporated in the latest versions of the mobile app.</p>

        <h2 class="left_1col">Role</h2>
        <p class="midContent right_3col">I was tasked to conceptualize ideas in form of wireframes and prototypes that were tested with end users across different iterations. I was paired with a full-time interaction designer and another intern to conduct user research for these concepts. Feedback received from these sessions was then incorporated into prototypes of which I had complete ownership of.</p>

           <h2>Business Goals &amp; Design Objectives</h2> 
           <p>Kodak Alaris had been working on a curation engine that utilized machine learning and AI to filter through a collection of pictures and highlight the user's best pictures (in terms of picture quality and picture content). </p>
           <p>Kodak's business goal was to utilize this functionality to increase the user engagement with their newly launched app, Kodak Moments. The team also wanted to test the concept of showcasing auto-created photo products from those pictures to users.</p>
           <p>The specific project objectives were as follows:</p>
           <div class="left_4col flexContainer">
           <div class="left_2col sticky">
           <ol>
           <li>Design workflows for upcoming curation functionalities (means for people to go through their photos using face recognition, location details, recurring events).</li>
           <li>Conceptualize means to relive photos.</li>
           <li>Test the idea of a showroom with users and get their thoughts on it.</li>
           </ol>

        <div class="left_4col"><p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham</p></div>
