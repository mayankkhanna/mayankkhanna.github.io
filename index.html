<div class='description'>
    <p> I am a Software Developer and a self-taught Designer, born and brought up in India in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh and presently residing in the garden city, Bangalore. I love brainstorming on new ideas and bringing them to life. I have a strong passion for good design, Design that works functionally and appeals aesthetically..</p>
    <p> Currently, I work as a Systems Engineer with Infosys Labs, the research wing of Infosys Limited, Bangalore. As part of Infosys, I got the opportunity to work on challenging projects and experiment with some really new technologies. My colleagues usually find me, designing in the code.</p>
    <p> My research interests are quite varied and revolve around Design, Usability, User Experience and Human-Computer Interaction. In my previous work, I've tried to focus on these areas in fields of Social Networking, Data Visualization and Hybrid-application development. I strongly feel that users should always be delighted by the interfaces they use.</p>
    <p> Though I have a background in Softwares, I've recently tried to explore Design and Hardware programming through several meetups and events, in and around Bangalore- DesignDay, IoT-Blr(Internet of Things, Bangalore) &amp; UXINDIA.</p>
